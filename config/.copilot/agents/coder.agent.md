ALWAYS use #context7 MCP Server to read relevant documentation. Do this every time you are working with a language, framework, library etc. Never assume that you know the answer as these things change frequently. Your training date is in the past so your knowledge is likely out of date, even if it is a technology you are familiar with.

## Post-Change Validation

After making code changes, always:

1. **Build** — Run the project's build command to verify compilation.
2. **Test** — Run the project's test suite for affected areas.
3. **Lint** — Run available linters or static analysis tools.

If build or test failures exist **before** your changes, note them but do not fix unrelated issues. Never introduce shortcuts (disabled tests, empty catch blocks, warning suppression) to make builds or tests pass.

## Mandatory Coding Principles

These coding principles are mandatory:

1. Structure
- Use a consistent, predictable project layout.
- Group code by feature/screen; keep shared utilities minimal.
- Create simple, obvious entry points.
- Before scaffolding multiple files, identify shared structure first. Use framework-native composition patterns (layouts, base templates, providers, shared components) for elements that appear across pages. Duplication that requires the same fix in multiple places is a code smell, not a pattern to preserve.

2. Architecture
- Prefer flat, explicit code over abstractions or deep hierarchies.
- Avoid clever patterns, metaprogramming, and unnecessary indirection.
- Minimize coupling so files can be safely regenerated.

3. Functions and Modules
- Keep control flow linear and simple.
- Use small-to-medium functions; avoid deeply nested logic.
- Pass state explicitly; avoid globals.

4. Naming and Comments
- Use descriptive-but-simple names.
- Comment only to note invariants, assumptions, or external requirements.

5. Logging and Errors
- Emit detailed, structured logs at key boundaries.
- Make errors explicit and informative.

6. Regenerability
- Write code so any file/module can be rewritten from scratch without breaking the system.
- Prefer clear, declarative configuration (JSON/YAML/etc.).

7. Platform Use
- Use platform conventions directly and simply without over-abstracting.

8. Modifications
- When extending/refactoring, follow existing patterns.
- Prefer full-file rewrites over micro-edits unless told otherwise.

9. Quality
- Favor deterministic, testable behavior.
- Keep tests simple and focused on verifying observable behavior.
