### GIT TRAILERS -- THESE MUST BE LAST IN THE COMMIT MESSAGE ###
#
# Git trailers are optional. Use them if you want, how you want.
# The trailers below are provided as examples that you can customize.
#
# For example, you can add any relevant links to a blog post, or graphic
# design images, or industry publications, specifications, tickets, etc.
#See: Description <https://example.com/...>
#See: Description <https://example.com/...>
#
# If the commit is written by multiple people, then use the git trailers
# to thank each person as a co-author; various git tools can track this.
#Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>
#Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>

# ## Help ##
#
# Subject line imperative uppercase verbs:
#
#   Add = Create a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
#   Drop = Delete a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.
#   Fix = Fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.
#   Bump = Increase the version of something e.g. a dependency.
#   Make = Change the build process, or tools, or infrastructure.
#   Start = Begin doing something; e.g. enable a toggle, feature flag, etc.
#   Stop = End doing something; e.g. disable a toggle, feature flag, etc.
#   Optimize = A change that MUST be just about performance, e.g. speed up code.
#   Document = A change that MUST be only in the documentation, e.g. help files.
#   Refactor = A change that MUST be just refactoring.
#   Reformat = A change that MUST be just format, e.g. indent line, trim space, etc.
#   Rephrase = A change that MUST be just textual, e.g. edit a comment, doc, etc.
#
# For the subject line:
#
#   * Use 50 characters maximum.
#
#   * Do not use a sentence-ending period.
#
# For the body text:
#
#   * Use as many lines as you like.
#
#   * Use 72 characters maximum per line for typical word wrap text.
#
#
# ## Trailers ##
#
# Trailers suitable for tracking and also for `git interpret-trailers`.
#
# Example of "See:" trailers that mean "see this additional information"
# and links to relevant web pages, issue trackers, blog posts, etc.:
#
#     See: https://example.com/
#     See: Issue #123 <https://example.com/issue/123>
#
# We like to use the "See:" trailers to link to issue trackers (e.g. Jira,
# Asana, Basecamp, Trello), document files and folders (e.g. Box, Dropbox),
# UI/UX designs (e.g. Figma, Lucidchart), reference pages (e.g. Wikipedia,
# internet RFCs, IEEE standards), and web posts (e.g. StackOverflow, HN).
#
# Example of "Co-authored-by:" trailers that list each author's name
# and their preferred commit message email address or contact URL:
#
#     Co-authored-by: Alice Adams <alice@example.com>
#     Co-authored-by: Bob Brown <https://bob.example.com>
#
# We like to use the "Co-authored-by:" trailers when we pair program,
# triple program, and group program. These are parsed automatically by
# some version control services (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) and will link
# to the authors' accounts and show up on the authors' commit history.
#
# Example of "Sponsored-by:" trailers that list each sponsor's name,
# which could be a person's or organization's, and contact email or URL:
#
#     Sponsored-by: Adam Anderson <adam@example.com>
#     Sponsored-by: Bravo Organization <https://bravo.example.com>
#
# The git tools require trailers to be last in a commit message,
# and must be one trailer per line, and with no extra lines between.
